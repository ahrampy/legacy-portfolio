### Hey There 👋

I'm a Software Engineer. I've also been a software engineering instructor, a middle school teacher, a restaurant manager, a sound technician, a beer slinger, and a full time skimmer of books.

Ask me anything about:

🌞 Some great places to go hiking and camping in NorCal.  
📚 The intersectionality of the many forms of education and coding.  
🍲 Food, rougelites, or building things out of wood.
