### Hey There 👋

I'm a Software Engineer. I've also been a software instructor, middle school teacher, restaurant manager, sound technician, beer slinger, and a skimmer of books.

Ask me anything about:

🌞 Some great places to go hiking and camping in Northern California. 
📚 The intersection of the many forms of education and coding. 
🍲 Food, rougelite and sim games, or novice woodworking.
