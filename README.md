### Hi!

Software Engineer by trade, I've also been a coding instructor, elementary school teacher, restaurant manager, sound tech, beer slinger, and a student of writing and rheotric.

Ask me anything about:

⛰️ Some great places to go hiking and camping in NorCal.  
📚 The intersectionality of the many forms of education and coding.  
🍲 Food, 👾 rougelites, 🪵 or refurbishing old furniture.
