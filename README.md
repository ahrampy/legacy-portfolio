### Hey There 👋

I'm a Software Engineer. Previous elementary and middle school teacher, restaurant manager, skimmer of books, and sound technician.

In my spare time recently I've been:

🎯 Working on a mobile game in React Native in collab w/ artist [masoncobrien](https://masoncobrien.com/) (it's gonna be awesome)  
🌞 Hiking, camping, fishing, and finding new places in nature   
🐍 Picking up Python and Flask!
